- Segments users by country, verification status, and subscription status

## Key Metrics

- open_msg
- visit_msg
- total_country_account_cnt
- total_country_sent_cnt
- rank_total_country_account_cnt
- rank_total_country_sent_cnt

## Tools Used

- Looker Studio (dashboard)

## Why It Matters

This project shows how I work with real data to answer business questions. I used CTEs, window functions, and UNION logic to build a clean dataset for visualization and decision-making.
